# Set a general rule for all files: Git will try to guess if they are text
# and, if so, will enforce LF line endings.
* text=auto eol=lf

# Set a specific, stronger rule for shell scripts.
# 'text' (without 'auto') forces Git to always treat these files as text
# and ensures they have LF line endings. This is critical for their
# execution in Linux/Docker environments.
*.sh text eol=lf
